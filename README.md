🌾 Crop Yield Prediction: Farming Meets AI! 🤖🌦️
🚜 What happens when AI meets agriculture? You get a crop yield prediction model that helps farmers grow better! No, this isn't Farmville 2.0—this is real data science helping us understand how rainfall, temperature, and pesticides impact crop yield.

📌 Project Overview
This project uses Linear Regression to predict crop yields based on:
✅ Rainfall (Because plants need water, duh!)
✅ Temperature (Too hot? Too cold? Let’s find the Goldilocks zone 🌡️)
✅ Pesticides (Are we using too much? Too little? Just right? 🐜💀)
✅ Year (Because farming changes over time! 📆)

With this data, our AI can tell if your cornfield will thrive 🌽 or just... struggle. 😅

🚀 How It Works
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing 📊

We merge rainfall, pesticides, temperature, and yield data into one dataset.

Remove unnecessary columns (bye-bye, Unnamed: 0 👋).

Train a Linear Regression Model 📈

We split the data into train & test sets.

Fit a Linear Regression model to learn from historical trends.

Make Predictions & Evaluate the Model 🤖

Predict yield for test data.

Measure accuracy using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² Score.

Visualize actual vs. predicted yield (because graphs make us look smart 📊).
