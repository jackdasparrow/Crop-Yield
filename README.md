# 🌾 Crop Yield Prediction: Farming Meets AI! 🤖🌦️  

🚜 **What happens when AI meets agriculture?** You get a **crop yield prediction model** that helps farmers grow better!  
No, this isn't *Farmville 2.0*—this is **real data science** helping us understand how **rainfall, temperature, and pesticides** impact crop yield.

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project uses **Linear Regression** to predict crop yields based on:  
✅ **Rainfall** (Because plants need water, duh!)  
✅ **Temperature** (Too hot? Too cold? Let’s find the Goldilocks zone 🌡️)  
✅ **Pesticides** (Are we using too much? Too little? Just right? 🐜💀)  
✅ **Year** (Because farming changes over time! 📆)  

With this data, our AI can tell if your **cornfield** will thrive 🌽 or just... struggle. 😅

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
This project is built using:  

### 📊 **Data Handling & Processing:**  
- `pandas` – For loading and preprocessing data  
- `numpy` – For numerical computations  

### 📈 **Machine Learning & Model Building:**  
- `scikit-learn` – For Linear Regression and model evaluation  

### 📊 **Visualization & Analysis:**  
- `matplotlib` – For plotting data trends  
- `seaborn` – For beautiful statistical graphs  

### 🛠 **Environment & Dependencies:**  
- `Python 3.x` – The core language  
- `Jupyter Notebook` *(optional)* – If you prefer interactive development

## 🚀 How It Works  
### 1️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing 📊  
- We merge **rainfall, pesticides, temperature, and yield data** into one dataset.  
- Remove unnecessary columns (bye-bye, `Unnamed: 0` 👋).  

### 2️⃣ Train a Linear Regression Model 📈  
- We split the data into **train & test sets**.  
- Fit a **Linear Regression model** to learn from historical trends.  

### 3️⃣ Make Predictions & Evaluate the Model 🤖  
- Predict yield for test data.  
- Measure accuracy using **Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² Score**.  
- Visualize actual vs. predicted yield (because graphs make us look smart 📊).
